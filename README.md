## üìë Project Overview

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The recommendation system is built using the [Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset) from Kaggle. The project includes a Jupyter Notebook for model development and a Flask-based web application to serve recommendations.

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

- **FinalRecommendationSystem.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.
- **app.py**: The Flask application script that serves the recommendation system via a web interface.
- **README.md**: Project documentation.

## üîç Key Analysis Steps

### Data Preprocessing:
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
- Prepared features for collaborative filtering and content-based filtering.

### Model Development:
- Implemented collaborative filtering using matrix factorization techniques.
- Developed content-based filtering to recommend movies based on content similarity.

### Evaluation:
- Evaluated the models using metrics like RMSE and precision at k.

### Visualization:
- Visualized recommendation results and performance metrics.
